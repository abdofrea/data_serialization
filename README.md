This Project is used to simulate the Data serialization process for encoding and decoding, using multiple protocols,
- ASN.1 PER, BER.
- Apache Avro.
- Protocol Buffer.
  

This is part of the article (Telecom CDRs Data Serialization and Simulation).

## Requirment
Each directory has it's own script for encoding and decoding and for more reference please chick the following libraries.
- asn1tools.
- fastavro.
- google.protobuf.
